# Coding Style Guide

## General rules

### Base rules
The base rules applied to this project are from the Google C++ Style Guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html.  
Any rule listed below takes precedence over the corresponding rule.  
For any rule/guidance not mentioned here, please refer to the base guide. 

### Naming

- User defined data types are in UpperCamelCase with the following prefixes:
<pre>
  Interface: IUpperCamelCase
  Class:     CUpperCamelCase
  Template:  TUpperCamelCase
  Struct:    SUpperCamelCase
  Enum:      EUpperCamelCase
  Union:     UUpperCamelCase
</pre>

- Variables are in lowerCamelCase
- Member variables are prefix with "m_": m_lowerCamelCase
- Private methods are in lowerCamelCase()
- Public methods and functions are UpperCamelCase()
- Enumeration members are in UpperCamelCase_UnderscoreTolerant
- constants are in UPPER_CASE
- Namespaces are in UpperCamelCase

### Formatting

- Indents are using TABs
  - 4 spaces long
  - Final align with spaces if needed
- No indents inside Namespaces
- Braces follow the Allman style for **type declarations and functions**:
    ```cpp
    CNewClass
    {  
        public:
               void PublicMethod();          
    }
    
    void CNewClass::PublicMethod()
    {
           ...
    }
        
    ```

### Commenting

Code must be documented with doxygen comments.  
Commonly used block comments are `///` or `/** */`.  
Commonly used inline comments are `///<` or `/**< */`.  
Below is an example of different styles:
```cpp 
/**
 * \brief Class for handling file writing/reading
 */
class CFileHandling
{
    public:
        ///
        /// \brief Constructor
        /// \param fileName The path to the file to handle
        ///
        explicit CFileHandling(const std::string& fileName);
        /**
         * @brief Opens file for reading or writing
         * @return true on success, false otherwise
         */
        bool OpenFile(const std::string& fileName);
    
        /// @brief Writes provided data to file
        ///
        /// @param data The data to be written
        /// @param append Flag set to true to append the data, or false to overwrite the file
        /// @return true on succes, false otherwise
        bool WriteToFile(const std::string& data, bool append=true);
        
    private:
        std::string m_file;  /**< The path to the file being handled */
        size_t m_fileSize;  ///< The current size of the file
}
```
Be mindful **not to mix styles** within a file or set of files.
