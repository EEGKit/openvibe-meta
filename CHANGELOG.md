    - `OpenViBE::uintXX` -> `uintXX_t`
    - `OpenViBE::intXX` -> `intXX_t`
    - `OpenViBE::float64` -> `double`
    - `OpenViBE::boolean` -> `bool`

    - `System::Memory::copy()` -> `std::memcpy()`
    - `System::Memory::move()` -> `std::memmove()`
    - `System::Memory::set()` -> `std::memset()`
    - `System::Memory::compare()` -> `std::memcmp()`
  - Namespaces starting with OpenViBE having been split:
    - `OpenViBEPlugins` -> `OpenViBE::Plugins`
    - `OpenViBEToolkit` -> `OpenViBE::Toolkit`
    - `OpenViBEVisualizationToolkit` -> `OpenViBE::VisualizationToolkit`
  - Some ClassId variables were renamed:
    - variables containing `StreamedMatrixStreamDecoder` renamed with `StreamedMatrixDecoder`
    - e.g. `OVP_GD_ClassId_Algorithm_StreamedMatrixStreamDecoder` -> `OVP_GD_ClassId_Algorithm_StreamedMatrixDecoder`
    - variables with `StreamedMatrixStreamEncoder` renamed with `StreamedMatrixEncoder`
    - e.g. `OVP_GD_ClassId_Algorithm_StreamedMatrixStreamEncoder` -> `OVP_GD_ClassId_Algorithm_StreamedMatrixEncoder`
    - variables with `SamplingRate` renamed with `Sampling`
    - e.g. `OVP_GD_Algorithm_SignalEncoder_InputParameterId_SamplingRate` -> `OVP_GD_Algorithm_SignalEncoder_InputParameterId_Sampling`
    - `OVP_ClassId_Plugin_VisualizationContext` -> `OVP_ClassId_Plugin_VisualizationCtx`
  - The include file `<openvibe/ovITimeArithmetics.h>` was removed and functionalities replaced:
    - New header: `#include <openvibe/ovITimeArithmetics.h>` -> `#include <openvibe/CTime.hpp>`
    - `TimeArithmetics::timeToSeconds(timeVar)` -> `CTime(timeVar).toSeconds()`
    - `TimeArrithmetics::SecondsToTime(timeVar)` -> `CTime(timeVar).time()`
    - `TimeArithmetics::TimeToSampleCount(freqVar, timeVar)` -> `CTime(time).toSampleCount(freqVar)`
  - In the package `ovp_main.cpp`, after the call to `OVP_Declare_Begin()`: `rPluginModuleContext` -> `context`
  - Signature of method `processInput()` overriden from class `TBoxAlgorithm` has changed (parameter type `uint32_t` -> `const size_t`):
    - `OpenViBE::boolean processInput(OpenViBE::uint32)` -> `bool processInput(const size_t index)`
  - Signature of method `hasFunctionality()` overridden from class `IPluginObjectDesc` (in sdk/openvibe/include/openvibe/plugins/ovIPluginObjectDesc.h) has changed:
    - `OpenViBE::boolean hasFunctionality(OpenViBE::CIdentifier functionalityIdentifier) const` -> `bool hasFunctionality(const EPluginFunctionality functionality) const`
    - `#define OVD_Functionality_Visualization` replaced by `EPluginFunctionality::Visualization`
  - Method renamed to match coding rules:
    - `TCPTagging::createStimulusSender()` -> `TCPTagging::CreateStimulusSender()`
  - Signature of box processClock() may have changed. Both were used, but now only the latter:
    - `bool processClock(Kernel::IMessageClock& msg)` -> `bool processClock(Kernel::CMessage& msg)`
